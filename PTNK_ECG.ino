       (default). If PGA is disabled you can still choose a gain factor up to 4. If PGA is
       enabled, the amplified voltage shall be between AVSS + 200mV and AVDD - 200mV. Outside
       this range linearity drops. For details check the data sheet, section 8.3.2.1.

       If you apply a single-ended mode (negative AINx = AVSS), PGA must be bypassed. Accordingly,
       the maximum gain is 4. The library does these settings automatically.

       For the measurement of reference voltages / supply voltage PGA will also be bypassed. In
       this case gain is 1.

       The parameters you can choose for setGain() are:
       ADS1220_GAIN_X with X = 1,2,4,8,16,32,64 or 128

       With getGainFactor() you can query the gain. The function returns the effective gain and
       not the gain set in the register. Under certian conditions thes are are different. For
       example, the effective gain is set to 1 when external references are measured.
